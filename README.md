## REAL TIME BUS TRACKER

This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation, and use recursive functions.

**Important highlights:**

-index.html - Calls a Google Maps API and MBTA V3 API Bus Route 1

**How to Use**

Download all the files into the same folder (blue.png and red.png). Open the index.html file in your browser. The Bus markers refresh ever 15 seconds. Blue bus marker goes one direction and red bus markers on oposite direction.

**Where to go from here:**

-I would like to Add pop-up with bus attributes such as: bus.attributes.ocupancy_status, bus.attributes.current_status and bus.attributes.bearing.
-Use other routes
